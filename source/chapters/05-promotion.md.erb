description: Learn where (and when) you should promote your community.

When it comes to marketing, the two most common mistakes are doing it too late, and doing it *too soon*.

You definitely don't want to limit yourself to the “build it and they will come” strategy and passively wait for people to discover your site. And you don't want to wait too long lest your brand new community becomes old news.

### Timing Is Everything

But you *also* don't want to start telling the world before your community is ready. [Don't call in the food critics to review your restaurant while it's still three-quarters empty](#twitter). 

What makes for a compelling community is, well, its *community*, and at this point it's barely getting started. So somewhere in between is the big launch sweet spot, and it's up to you to find it.

### Complementary Communities

So where should you go to to promote your site? A good method is reaching out to another community to help seed yours. 

Now while you could just try and poach a competing community's members, I believe instead that [the best approach is to target a *complementary* community](#twitter).

So if you're launching a forum about gardening, don't try to approach *another* gardening forum. Instead, reach out to gardening *chatrooms*, *blogs*, or *mailing lists*. Try to create two-way relationships between you and these other channels. They talk about you, and you in turn will promote their content to your members.

Slowly, through interactions on Twitter and a few postings on the official Meteor-Talk Google Group, a small user base started forming. I started cross posting discussions from Crater to r/Meteor on Reddit as another way to draw in new readers.", "Josh Owens" %>

If the other community allows it, cross-posting can also be a good way to increase awareness. You can sometimes even use tools like [IFTTT](https://ifttt.com/) to automate the process.

And don't forget to take advantage of social media as well. Even if you don't always point people back to your site, link-sharing is a great way to build up your audience and brand, and people will gravitate back towards your community eventually.

- Find three complementary channels on which to promote your community.
- Plug your community into some kind of auto-tweeting service (such as [Buffer](http://bufferapp.com)).
