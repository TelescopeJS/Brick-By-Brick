description: Should you limit access to your community, or open it to the world?

Given most startups' obsession with growth at all cost, one might reasonably wonder why you'd ever want to restrict sign-ups to your community. But it turns out there are a lot of good reasons to do so. 

### Supply & Demand

It's the oldest trick in the book: limit supply to drive up demand. If it works for diamonds, maybe it can work for you?

While the theory is sound, in practice the promise of exclusivity alone probably won't be enough to make your community attractive. After all, there are *already* countless exclusive communities around: why is yours better? 

[Exclusivity *combined* with actual value can work wonders](#twitter) though. [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com) has always been an invite-only site, and its invites are so sought-after that people hold contests to win them and have even set up entire parallel communities dedicated to getting invited.

### Quality Control

There's also cases where restricting access is necessary just to maintain a reasonable level of quality. Some communities tend to attract vocal minorities, and things can quickly get out of hand.

Learning from that experience, we decided to have a moderated website like Reddit. The moderation helps avoid spam and ensures we only have quality music on the site.", "Justin Kan" %>

### Setting An Example

Exclusivity has other advantages, especially in the first months of your community. Newer users tend to model their behavior after current members, so by filtering sign-ups you can make sure your initial batch of users sets the right tone for your community.

So unless your audience is very limited to begin with, limiting registrations is worth considering. Hopefully, the sign-ups you forfeit in the beginning will be offset by increased attention down the road thanks to your community's higher quality.

- If your community is already exclusive, set up a contest to win some invites.
- If it isn't, close registration down for a few days to see how people react.
