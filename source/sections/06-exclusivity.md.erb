Given most startups' obsession with growth at all cost, one might reasonably wonder why you'd ever want to restrict sign-ups to your community. But it turns out there are a lot of good reasons to do so. 

### Supply & Demand

It's the oldest trick in the book: limit supply to drive up demand. If it works for diamonds, maybe it can work for you?

While the theory is sound, in practice the promise of exclusivity alone probably won't be enough to make your community attractive. After all, there are *already* countless exclusive communities around: why is yours better? 

Exclusivity *combined* with actual value can work wonders though. [Dribbble](http://dribbble.com) has always been an invite-only site, and its invites are so sought-after that people hold contests to win them and have even set up entire parallel communities dedicated to getting invited.

### Setting An Example

Exclusivity has other advantages. Newer users tend to model their behavior after current members, so by filtering sign-ups you can make sure your initial batch of users sets the right tone for your community.

To make sure the community was of value, I used a top-down approach where I first invited other people that were authorities in the remote community already.
