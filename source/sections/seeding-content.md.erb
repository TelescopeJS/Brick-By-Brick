Nobody wants to be the first to leave a party. But you know that as soon as one person makes a move for their coat, pretty soon the whole place will end up empty. 

Similarly, users don't like to be the first to submit a link, ask a question, or post a comment. This is why it's very important that you **seed** your community with the type of content you'd like to see. 

Want people to post links? Start by posting links yourself. Want people to ask questions? Ask some yourself. Want people to leave comments? You get the idea.

Of course, after a while people will realize that you're posting every post, link, and comment yourself, and they'll be happy to leave it all up to you since you seem to be doing *such* a good job. 

To combat this, remember to regularly ask your friends to participate, or even create a few extra accounts for yourself (as [Reddit's founders famously did](http://motherboard.vice.com/read/how-reddit-got-huge-tons-of-fake-accounts--2)).
