The first thing to realize is the importance of doing – as Paul Graham puts it – [things that don't scale](http://paulgraham.com/ds.html), especially the early stages of your site.

What I mean by that is that the Facebook team obviously doesn't invite every new user individually. But you might have to do just that to kickstart your community. 

When launching [Product Hunt](http://www.producthunt.com/), Ryan Hoover personally invited dozens, if not hundreds of users. And that was after already doing the exact same thing for the now-defunct [Startup Edition](https://twitter.com/startupedition). 

So don't be shy about inviting people one by one, and even specifically asking them to leave a comment, post a link, or submit a question.

Start with your closest friends, and progressively work your way up to prominent figures in your field. 

For example, you could: 

1. Ask Friend A to post a link to an article.
2. Leave a comment on that article.
3. Ask Friend B to leave a comment as well.
4. Tell the article's author about the discussion, and invite them to contribute.

Sure, it took three emails, but in return you just created three happy users:

- Friend A is happy that his submission generated a discussion.
- Friend B is happy because Author X replied to their comment.
- Author X is happy because people are sharing and commenting on their work. 

And of course, you're happy because your site is taking off!

### Telescope Tip: Assigning Authors

Telescope lets admins assign a post to any user. 

So assuming Author X has created an account on your site but is too busy to contribute, you could post a link to their content yourself and then assign it to their profile.

- Invite 10 friends and 10 “celebrities” in your field to your new community.
