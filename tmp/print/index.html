        <p>Why do some communities take off while others become ghost towns?</p>
        
        <p>Building an audience is already tricky, but establishing a true <em>community</em> is even harder: not only do you need to reach users, but you also need to get them to engage. </p>
        
        <p>Setting up your blog, forum, or chat room is only the beginning. It&#39;s what you do after that will make all the difference. So in this guide, we&#39;ll explore 9 strategies you can use to make your community successful.</p>
        
        <p>Let&#39;s get started!</p>

            <p>That being said it, it should be equally applicable to forums, blogs, chat rooms, or any other type of community.</p>

          <div class='post-content'>
            <p>As long as the Internet has existed, virtual communities have always been around. In fact, they even predate the web. </p>
            
            <p>It seems hard to imagine now, but there was a time when “going online” meant logging on to a BBS or newsgroup, not opening a web browser.</p>
            
            <p>Of course, things have changed since. The arrival of the web also ushered in the era of discussion boards, which were then supplanted by blog comments, which were in turn overtaken by social networks.</p>
            
            <p>Today, we&rsquo;re living with a mix of traditional forums, comments, social media, as well as meta-communities like <a href="http://reddit.com">Reddit</a>. </p>
            
            <p>And new forms of communication pop up every day, as shown by the growing popularity of semi-public <a href="http://slack.com">Slack</a> channels (a.k.a. IRC 2.0) or the success of <a href="http://news.ycombinator.com">Hacker News</a>-type sites like <a href="http://producthunt.com">Product Hunt</a>. </p>
            
            <p>All this to say that one thing is clear: online communities are not going away. </p>
            
            <h3>Origin Story</h3>
            
            <p>Back in summer 2012, I had a sudden realization: Hacker News was perfect for discussing startups and programming. But it wasn&rsquo;t so great for anything related to design. So why not create a “Hacker News for designers”?</p>
            
            <p>After a few pivots, this wild idea ended up becoming <a href="http://sidebar.io">Sidebar</a>. But before I could get there, I had to solve a problem: unlike WordPress for blogs, there didn&rsquo;t seem to be any easy way to create your own Hacker News-type community. </p>
            
            <p>So I decided to build it myself. </p>
            
            <p>This was the start of <a href="http://telesc.pe">Telescope</a>, a free open-source project that lets anybody create and customize their own community. Since then, hundreds of people have deployed the app and thousands of users have created accounts.</p>
            
            <h3>Why This Guide</h3>
            
            <p>But I quickly realized that while Telescope could solve a lot of the technical challenges involved in launching a community, it couldn&rsquo;t make a community successful by itself.</p>
            
            <p>After all, actually growing the community and engaging its users was still up to the community manager, and a lot of  Telescope users were struggling with this new role. </p>
            
            <p>This why I decided to write this guide. </p>
            
            <h3>Credentials</h3>
            
            <p>So why should you trust me? Well first of all, because I&rsquo;ve done my research. I&rsquo;ve asked successful community builders such as <a href="http://producthunt.com">Product Hunt</a>&rsquo;s Ryan Hoover, <a href="http://hashtagnomads.com">#Nomads</a>&rsquo;s Pieter Levels, or <a href="http://productpeople.club">Product People Club</a>&rsquo;s Justin Jackson to share their experience with me, and added their input throughout this guide. </p>
            
            <p>I&rsquo;ve also successfuly built audiences a few times myself: both <a href="http://sidebar.io">Sidebar</a> and <a href="http://discovermeteor.com">Discover Meteor</a> have thousands of subscribers, and <a href="http://telesc.pe">Telescope</a> has quickly developed a vibrant open-source ecosystem. </p>
            
            <p>But the best way to make up your mind about this guide is probably just to read it. It&rsquo;s free, it&rsquo;s short, and it&rsquo;s split into nine chapters that you can read as you please.</p>
            
            <p>If that sounds good, let&rsquo;s get started by talking about the most fundamental aspect of building a community: <strong>your audience</strong>.</p>
            
            <h3>One More Thing</h3>
            
            <p>At the end of each chapter, you&rsquo;ll find a “Homework” box that gives a couple specific, practical things you can do right now to put the chapter&rsquo;s lessons in practice. </p>
            
            <p>You&rsquo;ll find the first box right below:</p>
            
            <div class="homework"><h4>Homework</h4><ul>

            </ul>
            </div>
          </div>
        </div>
        <div class='chapter-full-contents'>
          <div class='page-image'>
            <div class='image-wrapper'>
              <img class='chapter-icon svg' src='/images/audience.svg'>
            </div>
          </div>
          <div class='page-title section-title'>
            <h1 class='inner' data-content='Audience'>
              <span>Audience</span>
            </h1>
          </div>
          <div class='post-content'>
            <p>You don&rsquo;t want to have to suddenly announce to the 5000 members of your weightlifting community that moving forward, you will be refocusing on ice skating. </p>
            
            <p>That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;d better make sure you have the right target before you launch. When trying to narrow down your audience, you&rsquo;ll want to look for at least two of the following characteristics:</p>
            
            <h3>Well-defined</h3>
            
            <p>In this case, <a href="#twitter">the larger the target, the harder it will be to hit</a>. It&rsquo;ll be hard to foster an active and passionate community if you launch yet another site about “tech”. But if you pick a specific framework or programming language, you&rsquo;re already dramatically increasing your chances of seducing at least a few die-hard fans. </p>
            
            <h3>Reachable</h3>
            
            <p>It also helps to pick an audience that&rsquo;s already well-connected and easy to reach. It&rsquo;s going to be hard building a social network for fishermen if your audience spends half its time away at sea without Internet access. </p>
            
            <p>And “people who hate avocado” might be a well-defined market, but there are no existing places where you can easily reach all avocado haters, making it harder to acquire members. </p>
            
            <h3>Passionate</h3>
            
            <p>And finally, it always helps to find a topic your audience truly cares about. Either pick something people truly love (like the Twilight saga) or really hate (like the Twilight saga), just don&rsquo;t choose something that leaves your audience indifferent. </p>
            
            <p>As an example, many popular tech blogs have a massive audience, but their engagement in terms of comments is actually pretty low. The truth is that after the 30th “world-changing” new startup of the day, it&rsquo;s hard to care one way or the other. </p>
            
            <h3>Growing</h3>
            
            <p>Picking the right wave to right is an art in itself, but if you can do it you&rsquo;ll be well on your way to having a successful site. </p>
            
            <p>After all, when it comes to communities, network effects matter a lot. So being the first to address a specific domain can often be enough to tip the scales in your favor. </p>
            
            <p>We saw this with the success of <a href="http://discovermeteor.com">Discover Meteor</a>, a book about the <a href="http://meteor.com">Meteor</a> JavaScript framework written by Tom Coleman and myself. By being the first book to target a new platform, we were able to not only capture the lead (and keep it even as competing books launched), but also benefit from Meteor&rsquo;s own meteoric (pun intended) growth.</p>
            
            <div class="homework"><h4>Homework</h4><ul>
            <li>Say something controversial about your topic of choice on Twitter. See if people actually care or not. </li>
            <li>Use Google Trends to search for relevant keywords and get an idea of how fast your potential audience is growing. </li>
            </ul>

            </h1>
          </div>
          <div class='post-content'>
            <p>The first thing to realize is the importance of doing – as Paul Graham puts it – <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html">things that don&rsquo;t scale</a>, especially the early stages of your site.</p>
            
            <p>What I mean by that is that the Facebook team obviously doesn&rsquo;t invite every new user individually. But you might have to do just that to kickstart your community. </p>
            
            <h3>Individual Invites</h3>
            
            <p>When launching <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a>, Ryan Hoover personally invited dozens, if not hundreds of users. And that was after already doing the exact same thing for the now-defunct <a href="https://twitter.com/startupedition">Startup Edition</a>. </p>
            
            <p>So <a href="#twitter">don&rsquo;t be shy about inviting people one by one</a>, and even specifically asking them to leave a comment, post a link, or submit a question. </p>
            
            <p>Start with your closest friends, and progressively work your way up to prominent figures in your field. Most people will be happy to oblige, especially if it&rsquo;s to promote their own content. </p>
            
            <div class="quote"><div class="inner"><p>The most success we have had is with manually reaching out to people who write sales content. Whenever I read a sales related blog post, I’ll email the author about it, and suggest it’d be a great fit for the Closing Call audience so they should post it there. I’ve only had positive responses from each person I&rsquo;ve reached out to.</p><h4>Ryan Gum, <a href="http://closingcall.co">Closing Call</a></h4></div></div>
            
            <h3>An Invitation Blueprint</h3>
            
            <p>For example, you could: </p>
            
            <ol>
            <li>Ask Friend A to post a link to an article.</li>
            <li>Leave a comment on that article.</li>
            <li>Ask Friend B to leave a comment as well.</li>
            <li>Tell the article&rsquo;s author about the discussion, and invite them to contribute.</li>
            </ol>
            
            <p>Sure, it took three emails, but in return you just created three happy users:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>Friend A is happy that his submission generated a discussion.</li>
            <li>Friend B is happy because Author X replied to their comment.</li>
            <li>Author X is happy because people are sharing and commenting on their work. </li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>And of course, you&rsquo;re happy because your site is taking off!</p>
            
            <div class="quote"><div class="inner"><p>Our goal was to have a history so that when we launched the website the first users would see an active website, and not a realize they are actually our first real users.</p><h4>Justin Kan, <a href="http://thedrop.club">The Drop</a></h4></div></div>
            
            <h3>Seeding Content</h3>
            
            <p>This strategy extends to content, not just users. </p>
            
            <p>Nobody wants to be the first to leave a party. But you know that as soon as one person makes a move for their coat, pretty soon the whole place will end up empty. </p>
            
            <p>Similarly, users don&rsquo;t like to be the first to submit a link, ask a question, or post a comment. This is why it&rsquo;s very important that you <strong>seed</strong> your community with the type of content you&rsquo;d like to see. </p>
            
            <p><a href="#twitter">Want people to post links? Start by posting links yourself</a>. Want people to ask questions? Ask some yourself. Want people to leave comments? You get the idea.</p>
            
            <div class="quote"><div class="inner"><p>Every day, since I launched, I&rsquo;ve been manually curating content to post on the site. There are some days, especially in the first few months, where no one will post an article.</p><h4>Jean-Nicholas Hould, <a href="http://bootstrappers.io">Bootstrappers.io</a></h4></div></div>
            
            <p>Of course, after a while people will realize that you&rsquo;re posting every post, link, and comment yourself, and they&rsquo;ll be happy to leave it all up to you since you seem to be doing <em>such</em> a good job. </p>
            
            <p>To combat this, remember to regularly ask your friends to participate, or even create a few extra accounts for yourself (as <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/how-reddit-got-huge-tons-of-fake-accounts--2">Reddit&rsquo;s founders famously did</a> ).</p>

            <p>Let&rsquo;s suppose you&rsquo;ve managed to round up a few dozens smart people, who each have posted on your site a few times. Now all that&rsquo;s left is to lay back and watch the magic happen, right?</p>
            
            <p>Wrong! If you stop here, you&rsquo;ll pretty soon see traffic and engagement slide back down to zero, as people&rsquo;s busy lives take over and they forget to visit your site. </p>
            
            <p>This is why <a href="#twitter">it&rsquo;s very important to actively <strong>engage</strong> your community</a>. And the easiest way to do this is to get people to <strong>ask questions</strong>. </p>
            
            <p>Simple questions can result in extremely popular threads with dozens or hundreds of replies. Examples include:</p>
            
            <ul>
            <li>What are you working on?</li>
            <li>How would you improve this community?</li>
            <li>Who would you like us to invite here?</li>
            <li>Can you introduce yourself?</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>You can even make these threads into monthly events. For example, Hacker News features monthly “Who&rsquo;s Hiring?” and ”Freelancer? Seeking Freelancer?” threads to help members find jobs. </p>
            
            <div class="quote"><div class="inner"><p>Letting members have the spotlight has been a very successful way of growing engagement. Every month, I ask the community what they are working on. Those threads attract a lot of comments and are a great way for newcomers to introduce themselves.</p><h4>Jean-Nicholas Hould, <a href="http://bootstrappers.io">Bootstrappers.io</a></h4></div></div>
            
            <p>Of course, the ultimate question thread is the “AMA”, for “Ask Me Anything”, where you get a well-known personality to answer your members&rsquo; questions. </p>
            
            <p>Not only is this a fantastic way to generate engagement, it&rsquo;s also usually quite fun (not to mention a nice ego boost) for the person doing the answering, too. </p>
            
            <div class="quote"><div class="inner"><p>Since Bootstrappers.io launch in Septemeer &lsquo;14, we&rsquo;ve hosted more than a dozen AMA&rsquo;s with inspiring business bootstrappers.

            <p>The worst mistake you can make is building an audience without having any way to reach it again. </p>
            
            <p>You might be the top post on Hacker News today, but unless you can build some sort of connection with your newly-gained audience you&rsquo;ll be back to obscurity tomorrow. </p>
            
            <p>The most reliable way to build this connection is also the simplest: <strong>email</strong>. </p>
            
            <p>It&rsquo;s no coincidence if Product Hunt includes an email sign up field right on its homepage. In fact, the newsletter sign-up button is by far the most prominent call to action (Product Hunt doesn&rsquo;t even <em>have</em> a regular “sign up” button).</p>
            
            <figure class=""><a href="http://producthunt.com" target="_blank"><img src="/images/producthunt.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Product Hunt puts the newsletter front and center.</figcaption></figure>
            
            <p>This is also why Telescope includes an <a href="http://www.telesc.pe/docs/packages/newsletter/">email newsletter package</a> out of the box. That package automatically takes your site&rsquo;s top content, and generates a daily or weekly digest from it.</p>
            
            <div class="quote"><div class="inner"><p>The automated newsletter [has been] a big winner, with pretty good open and click through rates.</p><h4>Ryan Gum, <a href="http://closingcall.co">Closing Call</a></h4></div></div>
            
            <p>Note that Telescope integrates with <a href="http://mailchimp.com/">MailChimp</a>. So while you can of course use Telescope&rsquo;s generated email newsletters, you&rsquo;re by no means limited to them. You can take advantage of all of MailChimp&rsquo;s features to send any kind of emails to your community&rsquo;s list. </p>
            
            <figure class="pull-right"><a href="http://bootstrappers.io" target="_blank"><img src="/images/bootstrappersio-email.jpg"/></a><figcaption>Bootstrappers.io often sends special announcements to its list.</figcaption></figure>
            
            <p>For example, <a href="http://bootstrappers.io">Bootstrappers.io</a> sends its list custom email announcements for <a href="http://us9.campaign-archive1.com/?u=80d2ecfdc1dcd9bf5118c3b36&amp;id=00be906127&amp;e=678d5d3803">upcoming AMAs</a>.</p>
            
            <p>And once someone is signed up to your list, it can be a great idea to send them a pre-scheduled content sequence. </p>
            
            <p>Emails could include your community guidelines, a “best of” guide pointing to a few classic posts, or even just a short welcome message. </p>
            
            <p>Remember that new members won&rsquo;t have the habit of regularly visiting your site yet, so <a href="#twitter">you&rsquo;ll have to go and find your users where they live: their inbox!</a></p>

            <p>When it comes to marketing, the two most common mistakes are doing it too late, and doing it <em>too soon</em>.</p>
            
            <p>You definitely don&rsquo;t want to limit yourself to the “build it and they will come” strategy and passively wait for people to discover your site. And you don&rsquo;t want to wait too long lest your brand new community becomes old news.</p>
            
            <h3>Timing Is Everything</h3>
            
            <p>But you <em>also</em> don&rsquo;t want to start telling the world before your community is ready. <a href="#twitter">Don&rsquo;t call in the food critics to review your restaurant while it&rsquo;s still three-quarters empty</a>. </p>
            
            <p>What makes for a compelling community is, well, its <em>community</em>, and at this point it&rsquo;s barely getting started. So somewhere in between is the big launch sweet spot, and it&rsquo;s up to you to find it.</p>
            
            <h3>Complementary Communities</h3>
            
            <p>So where should you go to to promote your site? A good method is reaching out to another community to help seed yours. </p>
            
            <p>Now while you could just try and poach a competing community&rsquo;s members, I believe instead that <a href="#twitter">the best approach is to target a <em>complementary</em> community</a>.</p>
            
            <p>So if you&rsquo;re launching a forum about gardening, don&rsquo;t try to approach <em>another</em> gardening forum. Instead, reach out to gardening <em>chatrooms</em>, <em>blogs</em>, or <em>mailing lists</em>. Try to create two-way relationships between you and these other channels. They talk about you, and you in turn will promote their content to your members. </p>
            
            <div class="quote"><div class="inner"><p>At first I had to spend time every day getting posts up on Crater, because no one knew about it. Slowly, through interactions on Twitter and a few postings on the official Meteor-Talk Google Group, a small user base started forming. I started cross posting discussions from Crater to r/Meteor on Reddit as another way to draw in new readers.</p><h4>Josh Owens, <a href="http://crater.io">Crater.io</a></h4></div></div>
            
            <p>If the other community allows it, cross-posting can also be a good way to increase awareness. You can sometimes even use tools like <a href="https://ifttt.com/">IFTTT</a> to automate the process.</p>
            
            <p>And don&rsquo;t forget to take advantage of social media as well. Even if you don&rsquo;t always point people back to your site, link-sharing is a great way to build up your audience and brand, and people will gravitate back towards your community eventually. </p>

          <div class='post-content'>
            <p>Given most startups&rsquo; obsession with growth at all cost, one might reasonably wonder why you&rsquo;d ever want to restrict sign-ups to your community. But it turns out there are a lot of good reasons to do so. </p>
            
            <h3>Supply &amp; Demand</h3>
            
            <p>It&rsquo;s the oldest trick in the book: limit supply to drive up demand. If it works for diamonds, maybe it can work for you?</p>
            
            <p>While the theory is sound, in practice the promise of exclusivity alone probably won&rsquo;t be enough to make your community attractive. After all, there are <em>already</em> countless exclusive communities around: why is yours better? </p>
            
            <p><a href="#twitter">Exclusivity <em>combined</em> with actual value can work wonders</a> though. <a href="http://dribbble.com">Dribbble</a> has always been an invite-only site, and its invites are so sought-after that people hold contests to win them and have even set up entire parallel communities dedicated to getting invited.</p>
            
            <h3>Quality Control</h3>
            
            <p>There&rsquo;s also cases where restricting access is necessary just to maintain a reasonable level of quality. Some communities tend to attract vocal minorities, and things can quickly get out of hand. </p>
            
            <div class="quote"><div class="inner"><p>From Twitch.tv, I learned that when you have a popular platform people will join to abuse your platform for personal gain, or just do things to make the experience worse for everybody. Learning from that experience, we decided to have a moderated website like Reddit. The moderation helps avoid spam and ensures we only have quality music on the site.</p><h4>Justin Kan, <a href="http://thedrop.club">The Drop</a></h4></div></div>
            
            <h3>Setting An Example</h3>
            
            <p>Exclusivity has other advantages, especially in the first months of your community. Newer users tend to model their behavior after current members, so by filtering sign-ups you can make sure your initial batch of users sets the right tone for your community.</p>
            
            <div class="quote"><div class="inner"><p>To make sure the community was of value, I used a top-down approach where I first invited other people that were authorities in the remote community already.</p><h4>Pieter Levels, <a href="http://hashtagnomads.com">#Nomads</a></h4></div></div>
            
            <p>So unless your audience is very limited to begin with, limiting registrations is worth considering. Hopefully, the sign-ups you forfeit in the beginning will be offset by increased attention down the road thanks to your community&rsquo;s higher quality.</p>
            
            <div class="quote"><div class="inner"><p>By keeping things invite only, we were able to cultivate the personality of the site before bringing in the masses. I believe that if you have a high-quality community, growth will come naturally.</p><h4>Kelly Sutton, <a href="http://news.layervault.com">Designer News</a></h4></div></div>

            <h3>Reinvesting Content</h3>
            
            <p>To pick a concrete example, let&rsquo;s say you&rsquo;ve just held an AMA with some famous expert, and managed to generate a decent amount of content. Don&rsquo;t move on just yet!</p>
            
            <p>Why not write a blog post compiling the best questions and answers? Or even package together some kind of eBook you can give out when people sign up for your community?</p>
            
            <h3>Stats Sell</h3>
            
            <p>And even without special content, your community itself can be a source of news and data. You can blog about the most popular domains, talk about traffic stats, or publish monthly user rankings. </p>
            
            <p><a href="http://okcupid.com">OKCupid</a> got huge amounts of free publicity by <a href="http://blog.okcupid.com/index.php/the-best-questions-for-first-dates/">publishing elaborate analysis of their own statistics</a> on their OKTrends blog. </p>

            <p>So far we&rsquo;ve talked about getting users and engaging them. But how do you keep them coming back over the long term?</p>
            
            <p>The key is <em>providing value</em>. </p>
            
            <p>Or, as <a href="http://groupbuzz.io/">GroupBuzz</a>&rsquo;s Alex Hillman <a href="http://blog.groupbuzz.io/what-to-do-when-your-community-slows-down-and-why-its-not-always-a-bad-thing/">puts it</a>, “your job [as community manager] is to help members participate at a level that balances <strong>the value they receive</strong> from the community as well as <strong>the value they provide</strong> to the community”.</p>
            
            <p>In some cases, providing a place for members to engage in conversation will be enough to balance out the equation. But in other cases, you might have to go the extra mile to keep your members happy.</p>
            
            <h3>The Power Of Listening</h3>
            
            <p>One simple way to provide value is simply to <strong>listen</strong>. It turns out it can sometimes be surprisingly hard to get people to pay attention to your work. Twitter, Facebook, and Reddit might sometimes prove themselves useful allies in spreading the word, but they can also have the inverse effect and bury any new initiative under a mountain of memes and cat pictures. </p>
            
            <p>So having <a href="#twitter">a place where you <em>know</em> people will pay attention can be hugely valuable in itself</a>. As always though, your job is to keep things balanced to prevent your community from devolving into a self-promotion shouting match.</p>

            <p>Successful blogs usually have their own special voice. And so do successful communities, even if they&rsquo;re made up of hundreds – or thousands – of different individuals. </p>
            
            <p>But finding that voice isn&rsquo;t always easy. Many communities form around a topic, but without any common culture holding them together they dissolve as soon as something better comes along.</p>
            
            <p>So don&rsquo;t make the mistake of wanting to please everybody. A strong voice might turn away some people, but it will make the ones who stay a lot more passionate about your community. </p>
            
            <h3>Design Matters…</h3>
            
            <p>A common way to express your voice is through design.</p>
            
            <p><a href="http://news.layervault.com">Designer News</a> offers the perfect case study: although the site&rsquo;s design might outwardly seem bare and minimalist, it&rsquo;s filled with the kind of small details that designers appreciate.</p>
            
            <p>As an example, some posts automatically get special badges when they include specific keywords. Showcase posts get the “Show DN” badge, XXX… and any posts mentioning “flat design” gets the “beating a dead horse” badge.</p>
            
            <p>Designer News also lets its member create their own avatars through a simple in-browser pixel art editor. But the Designer News team went one step further by matching up avatar colors with specific criteria.</p>
            
            <p>Reach 100 karma, and you&rsquo;ll unlock blue. Reach 200, and you&rsquo;ll get green. There&rsquo;s even colors for attending real-life Designer News meet-ups.</p>
            
            <div class="quote"><div class="inner"><p>Early on, we would spend our Fridays hacking on Designer News, so most of the time you would see discrete projects pop up, like the badges or the avatars. Both were meant as ways to add character to the site, and I think they do a good job at that.</p><h4>Kelly Sutton, <a href="http://news.layervault.com">Designer News</a></h4></div></div>
            
            <p>All this contributes to a strong sense of community: getting an orange avatar on Designer News <em>means</em> something in a way that uploading a new Twitter profile pic simply doesn&rsquo;t. </p>
            
            <h3>…Or Not</h3>
            
            <p>So what about communities like Hacker News or Reddit, who are often criticized for, shall we say, their lack of aesthetic sense? Well <a href="#twitter">in some cases, “un-design” can be just as powerful to give a community its voice</a>. </p>
            
            <p>Hacker News&rsquo; bare-bones, 1998-style design conveys a strong sense of function over form: it&rsquo;s not pretty but it works, and that&rsquo;s what ultimately matters. So it&rsquo;s no coincidence if Hacker News attracts a majority of technical, DIY hacker types. In this case, the medium and the message match up perfectly. </p>
            
            <p>The same goes with Reddit. Its design might not look like much, but this simplicity makes it much easier for individual subreddits to customize their layout. Reddit values freedom and self-expression above all, and here too design (or the lack of it) serves to reinforce the community&rsquo;s voice. </p>
            
            <div class="quote"><div class="inner"><p>I think it would be an error to try to force the community culture you envisioned because you will end up alienating your users.</p><h4>Justin Kan, <a href="http://thedrop.club">The Drop</a></h4></div></div>
            
            <h3>All In Moderation</h3>
            
            <p>Of course, design isn&rsquo;t everything. Moderation also plays a big part in shaping a community&rsquo;s voice. Large communities like Reddit or Hacker News possess an array of moderation tools, from flagging a post to lower its place in the rankings, to banning users altogether. </p>
            
            <div class="quote"><div class="inner"><p>We are always actively shaping the community through both positive (rewards) or negative (banning, etc.) actions.</p><h4>Kelly Sutton, <a href="http://news.layervault.com">Designer News</a></h4></div></div>
            
            <p>So it&rsquo;s up to you to highlight the type of content you want to see more of, and downplay (or outright remove) items that don&rsquo;t match your vision, and generally speaking you shouldn&rsquo;t be too shy about laying down the law. As much as we&rsquo;d like them to be, online communities are not supposed to be democracies: not every voice is equal, and not everybody deserves to be part of them.</p>
            
            <p>As long as you stay polite and do your best to be transparent with your decisions, the majority of members will appreciate your efforts to steer the ship.  </p>
            
            <div class="quote"><div class="inner"><p>As much as you try to shape a community&rsquo;s voice and culture, it will always arise organically. That being said the culture that arises depends a lot on the infrastructure you build for them. So in the end you build the infrastructure that you think will foster the type of community you want to have, but once you build the platform you lose control and the culture evolves naturally.</p><h4>Justin Kan, <a href="http://thedrop.club">The Drop</a></h4></div></div>

            <p>So what now? </p>
            
            <p>The recurring theme behind every conversation I had while researching this topic was that communities only thrive when you put in the time and effort to care for them.</p>
            
            <p>That work often happens behind scenes and – if you&rsquo;re doing it right – probably won&rsquo;t ever be noticed by your members, which can make it unrewarding, or even frustrating at times. Yet it&rsquo;s still a necessary condition to a successful community. </p>
            
            <h3>No Rush</h3>
            
            <p>The other lesson I took from this is that things can take a while. <a href="#twitter">When it comes to building communities, time is measured in months and years, not days and weeks</a>. </p>
            
            <p>You can&rsquo;t rush things by buying ad traffic or purchasing likes on Facebook. If you truly want to build a great community you&rsquo;ll simply have to provide value, engage with members, and repeat the process day after day after day. </p>
            
            <h3>No Easy Task</h3>
            
            <p>All this to say that growing a community is no easy task. But hopefully, the lessons I&rsquo;ve shared here will help point you in the right direction. </p>
            
            <p>The best you can do now is take it one day at a time, and try to improve things bit by bit. </p>
