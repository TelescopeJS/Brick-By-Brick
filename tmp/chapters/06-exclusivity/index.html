        <p>Given most startups&rsquo; obsession with growth at all cost, one might reasonably wonder why you&rsquo;d ever want to restrict sign-ups to your community. But it turns out there are a lot of good reasons to do so. </p>
        
        <h3>Supply &amp; Demand</h3>
        
        <p>It&rsquo;s the oldest trick in the book: limit supply to drive up demand. If it works for diamonds, maybe it can work for you?</p>
        
        <p>While the theory is sound, in practice the promise of exclusivity alone probably won&rsquo;t be enough to make your community attractive. After all, there are <em>already</em> countless exclusive communities around: why is yours better? </p>
        
        <p><a href="#twitter">Exclusivity <em>combined</em> with actual value can work wonders</a> though. <a href="http://dribbble.com">Dribbble</a> has always been an invite-only site, and its invites are so sought-after that people hold contests to win them and have even set up entire parallel communities dedicated to getting invited.</p>
        
        <h3>Quality Control</h3>
        
        <p>There&rsquo;s also cases where restricting access is necessary just to maintain a reasonable level of quality. Some communities tend to attract vocal minorities, and things can quickly get out of hand. </p>
        
        <div class="quote"><div class="inner"><p>From Twitch.tv, I learned that when you have a popular platform people will join to abuse your platform for personal gain, or just do things to make the experience worse for everybody. Learning from that experience, we decided to have a moderated website like Reddit. The moderation helps avoid spam and ensures we only have quality music on the site.</p><h4>Justin Kan, <a href="http://thedrop.club">The Drop</a></h4></div></div>
        
        <h3>Setting An Example</h3>
        
        <p>Exclusivity has other advantages, especially in the first months of your community. Newer users tend to model their behavior after current members, so by filtering sign-ups you can make sure your initial batch of users sets the right tone for your community.</p>
        
        <div class="quote"><div class="inner"><p>To make sure the community was of value, I used a top-down approach where I first invited other people that were authorities in the remote community already.</p><h4>Pieter Levels, <a href="http://hashtagnomads.com">#Nomads</a></h4></div></div>
        
        <p>So unless your audience is very limited to begin with, limiting registrations is worth considering. Hopefully, the sign-ups you forfeit in the beginning will be offset by increased attention down the road thanks to your community&rsquo;s higher quality.</p>
        
        <div class="quote"><div class="inner"><p>By keeping things invite only, we were able to cultivate the personality of the site before bringing in the masses. I believe that if you have a high-quality community, growth will come naturally.</p><h4>Kelly Sutton, <a href="http://news.layervault.com">Designer News</a></h4></div></div>

        <li>If your community is already exclusive, set up a contest to win some invites.</li>
        <li>If it isn&rsquo;t, close registration down for a few days to see how people react.</li>
