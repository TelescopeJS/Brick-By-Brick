        <p>You don&rsquo;t want to have to suddenly announce to the 5000 members of your weightlifting community that moving forward, you will be refocusing on ice skating. </p>
        
        <p>That&rsquo;s why you&rsquo;d better make sure you have the right target before you launch. When trying to narrow down your audience, you&rsquo;ll want to look for at least two of the following characteristics:</p>
        
        <h3>Well-defined</h3>
        
        <p>In this case, <a href="#twitter">the larger the target, the harder it will be to hit</a>. It&rsquo;ll be hard to foster an active and passionate community if you launch yet another site about “tech”. But if you pick a specific framework or programming language, you&rsquo;re already dramatically increasing your chances of seducing at least a few die-hard fans. </p>
        
        <h3>Reachable</h3>
        
        <p>It also helps to pick an audience that&rsquo;s already well-connected and easy to reach. It&rsquo;s going to be hard building a social network for fishermen if your audience spends half its time away at sea without Internet access. </p>
        
        <p>And “people who hate avocado” might be a well-defined market, but there are no existing places where you can easily reach all avocado haters, making it harder to acquire members. </p>
        
        <h3>Passionate</h3>
        
        <p>And finally, it always helps to find a topic your audience truly cares about. Either pick something people truly love (like the Twilight saga) or really hate (like the Twilight saga), just don&rsquo;t choose something that leaves your audience indifferent. </p>
        
        <p>As an example, many popular tech blogs have a massive audience, but their engagement in terms of comments is actually pretty low. The truth is that after the 30th “world-changing” new startup of the day, it&rsquo;s hard to care one way or the other. </p>
        
        <h3>Growing</h3>
        
        <p>Picking the right wave to right is an art in itself, but if you can do it you&rsquo;ll be well on your way to having a successful site. </p>
        
        <p>After all, when it comes to communities, network effects matter a lot. So being the first to address a specific domain can often be enough to tip the scales in your favor. </p>
        
        <p>We saw this with the success of <a href="http://discovermeteor.com">Discover Meteor</a>, a book about the <a href="http://meteor.com">Meteor</a> JavaScript framework written by Tom Coleman and myself. By being the first book to target a new platform, we were able to not only capture the lead (and keep it even as competing books launched), but also benefit from Meteor&rsquo;s own meteoric (pun intended) growth.</p>

        <li>Say something controversial about your topic of choice on Twitter. See if people actually care or not. </li>
        <li>Use Google Trends to search for relevant keywords and get an idea of how fast your potential audience is growing. </li>
