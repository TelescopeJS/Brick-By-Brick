        <p>The first thing to realize is the importance of doing – as Paul Graham puts it – <a href="http://paulgraham.com/ds.html">things that don&rsquo;t scale</a>, especially the early stages of your site.</p>
        
        <p>What I mean by that is that the Facebook team obviously doesn&rsquo;t invite every new user individually. But you might have to do just that to kickstart your community. </p>
        
        <h3>Individual Invites</h3>
        
        <p>When launching <a href="http://www.producthunt.com/">Product Hunt</a>, Ryan Hoover personally invited dozens, if not hundreds of users. And that was after already doing the exact same thing for the now-defunct <a href="https://twitter.com/startupedition">Startup Edition</a>. </p>
        
        <p>So <a href="#twitter">don&rsquo;t be shy about inviting people one by one</a>, and even specifically asking them to leave a comment, post a link, or submit a question. </p>
        
        <p>Start with your closest friends, and progressively work your way up to prominent figures in your field. Most people will be happy to oblige, especially if it&rsquo;s to promote their own content. </p>
        
        <div class="quote"><div class="inner"><p>The most success we have had is with manually reaching out to people who write sales content. Whenever I read a sales related blog post, I’ll email the author about it, and suggest it’d be a great fit for the Closing Call audience so they should post it there. I’ve only had positive responses from each person I&rsquo;ve reached out to.</p><h4>Ryan Gum, <a href="http://closingcall.co">Closing Call</a></h4></div></div>
        
        <h3>An Invitation Blueprint</h3>
        
        <p>For example, you could: </p>
        
        <ol>
        <li>Ask Friend A to post a link to an article.</li>
        <li>Leave a comment on that article.</li>
        <li>Ask Friend B to leave a comment as well.</li>
        <li>Tell the article&rsquo;s author about the discussion, and invite them to contribute.</li>
        </ol>
        
        <p>Sure, it took three emails, but in return you just created three happy users:</p>
        
        <ul>
        <li>Friend A is happy that his submission generated a discussion.</li>
        <li>Friend B is happy because Author X replied to their comment.</li>
        <li>Author X is happy because people are sharing and commenting on their work. </li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>And of course, you&rsquo;re happy because your site is taking off!</p>
        
        <div class="quote"><div class="inner"><p>Our goal was to have a history so that when we launched the website the first users would see an active website, and not a realize they are actually our first real users.</p><h4>Justin Kan, <a href="http://thedrop.club">The Drop</a></h4></div></div>
        
        <h3>Seeding Content</h3>
        
        <p>This strategy extends to content, not just users. </p>
        
        <p>Nobody wants to be the first to leave a party. But you know that as soon as one person makes a move for their coat, pretty soon the whole place will end up empty. </p>
        
        <p>Similarly, users don&rsquo;t like to be the first to submit a link, ask a question, or post a comment. This is why it&rsquo;s very important that you <strong>seed</strong> your community with the type of content you&rsquo;d like to see. </p>
        
        <p><a href="#twitter">Want people to post links? Start by posting links yourself</a>. Want people to ask questions? Ask some yourself. Want people to leave comments? You get the idea.</p>
        
        <div class="quote"><div class="inner"><p>Every day, since I launched, I&rsquo;ve been manually curating content to post on the site. There are some days, especially in the first few months, where no one will post an article.</p><h4>Jean-Nicholas Hould, <a href="http://bootstrappers.io">Bootstrappers.io</a></h4></div></div>
        
        <p>Of course, after a while people will realize that you&rsquo;re posting every post, link, and comment yourself, and they&rsquo;ll be happy to leave it all up to you since you seem to be doing <em>such</em> a good job. </p>
        
        <p>To combat this, remember to regularly ask your friends to participate, or even create a few extra accounts for yourself (as <a href="http://motherboard.vice.com/read/how-reddit-got-huge-tons-of-fake-accounts--2">Reddit&rsquo;s founders famously did</a> ).</p>
